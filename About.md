# About Soul and Salary

👋 Welcome to **Soul and Salary** — a space where money meets meaning.

This blog was born from a simple truth:  
✨ *We are not just chasing paychecks — we're seeking peace, purpose, and personal power.*

## Why Soul and Salary?

I’ve seen high-performing professionals struggle silently with:

- 💰 Guilt or confusion around money
- 😞 Emotional burnout at work
- 🧠 Subconscious beliefs that sabotage their success

This blog explores the intersection of:

- **Financial confidence** without shame
- **Mindset rewiring** that works in real life
- **Emotional well-being** for professionals

## What You’ll Find Here

- Real stories and reflections
- Tools to rewire how you relate to money
- Soulful nudges to design your work life with intention

## Who am I?

I’m a banking professional by day, and a reflective writer by night —  
on a mission to help others heal their relationship with money and work.
